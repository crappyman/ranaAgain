2) print the greatest of 3 numbers
3) print if a number is even or odd
4) print odd numbers upto N
5) print the factorial of a number

7) print the sum of the digits of a number
	567 means output should be 18 ( 5+6+7)
8) print the fibonacci series upto N
	0 1 1 2
1) find the sum of n numbers taken as input from user/ hard coded values
2) print the number of times an element is present in an array
	int[] numbers = { 10, 20, 30, 10, 40, 50, 20, 10}

expected output
	10 - 3
	20 - 2
	30 - 1
	40 - 1
	50 - 1

3) matrix addition
4) multiply 2 matrices	
5) an example on irregular dimensional array
